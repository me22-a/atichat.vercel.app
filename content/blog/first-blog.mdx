<h3>Hi this is my first blog post</h3>

<p>I thus spent a lot of time creating a blog page. Previously, I had a projects page that used markdown (.md) files; however, I moved to MDX to give it more flexibility, and it turned out very well.</p>

<p>I use <strong>Velite</strong> since it simplifies QoL by defining collections. validation of the contents and schema by <strong>Zod</strong></p>
