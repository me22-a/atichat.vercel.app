### Hi this is my first blog post

I thus spent a lot of time creating a blog page. Previously, I had a projects page that used markdown (.md) files; however, I moved to MDX to give it more flexibility, and it turned out very well.

I use **Velite** since it simplifies QoL by defining collections. validation of the contents and schema by **Zod**.

Then I got issue can't deploy on **Vercel** here:

```
free(): invalid size

Error: Command "npm run build" exited with SIGABRT
```

has no idea how to fix this. ðŸ¥¹ðŸ¥¹

I rollback to using markdown (.md), so this is just starting to try something new. I got knowledge about `remark`,Â `remarkGfm`,Â `remarkParse`, `remarkRehype`, andÂ `rehypeStringify`. These are going to make the website a bit more special.
