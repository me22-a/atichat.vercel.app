This is the body of my Markdown file.

I can use different types of Markdown syntax to format my text, such as headings, lists, and code blocks.

For example, I can create a heading by starting a line with one or more hash symbols (`#`). The number of hash symbols determines the level of the heading. For example, a single hash symbol (`#`) creates a level 1 heading, two hash symbols (`##`) create a level 2 heading, and so on.

I can also create lists by starting a line with an asterisk (`*`) or a hyphen (`-`). For example, the following code will create an unordered list:

```
* Item 1
* Item 2
* Item 3
```

And the following code will create an ordered list:

```
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
3. Item 3
```

I can also create code blocks by enclosing my code in three backticks (`````). For example, the following code will create a code block:

```
def my_function(x):
  return x + 1

print(my_function(10))
```

This will print the following output to the console:

"
11
"

I can also use Markdown to create links, images, and tables. For more information on Markdown syntax, please see the Markdown documentation: https://www.markdownguide.org/.
